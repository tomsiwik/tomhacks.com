Special thanks to [chanhdai](https://x.com/iamncdai) for creating this awesome starter for me.
I now have an awesome website to play around with shadcn, create my own shareable components and
just blog and goof around.

Let's keep it simple for the first post. Here's the stack used for this website:

## Tech Stack

The golden trifecta of indiehacking (that's what you'll find constantly mentioned on ùïè ):

- Next.js 15: Latest React framework for optimized performance and scalability
- Tailwind CSS v4: Modern utility-first CSS framework for styling
- shadcn/ui: Pre-built components with beautiful design and accessibility

## Featured

- Elegant & Minimalistic UI: Clean and modern design
- Dark Mode: Supports light and dark themes for a better user experience
- vCard Integration: Digital business card with contact details
- SEO Optimization: [JSON-LD schema](https://json-ld.org), sitemap, robots
- AI-friendly [/llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org): Adds a `/llms.txt` file to help AI models identify and interact with site content.
- Email Protection: Obfuscation to prevent spam
- Installable PWA

## Blog

- MDX & Markdown support
- Access markdown by adding `.md` to URLs, e.g. `/blog/welcome.md`
- Syntax Highlighting for better readability
- RSS Feed for easy content distribution
- Dynamic OG Images for rich previews

## Component Registry

_Probably my favorite part of this starter._

Easily build and distribute your own components, hooks, and pages using a custom registry powered by the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

Each component is well-documented through the Blog, featuring:

- **Live Preview**: Interactive component demos
- **Code Snippets**: Readable and copyable examples
- **Beautiful Code Blocks**: Styled for clarity and dark mode
- **Command Blocks**: One-click copy for quick install commands (`pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`, `bun`)
